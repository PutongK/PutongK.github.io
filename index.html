            I am a Ph.D. candidate in Mechanical Engineering at Northwestern University working with Prof. <a href="https://www.cao.mech.northwestern.edu/jiancao/" target="_blank">Jian Cao</a> and Prof. <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/ehmann-kornel.html" target="_blank">Kornel Ehmann</a>, specializing in advanced manufacturing, incremental sheet forming (ISF), and process-driven shape control. My work integrates experimental system development with analytical modeling to create new forming and texturing methods that enhance surface quality, precision, and process efficiency.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have collaborated with academic and industry partners, including General Motors, on projects that advance digital manufacturing and sustainable forming technologies. With experience spanning prototyping, system integration, data analysis, and international research coordination, I aim to contribute to R&D, product development, or technology-focused consulting roles where I can apply data-driven problem-solving to real-world engineering challenges.

      <h2>Selected Projects</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Texture-Induced Morphing for Programmable Sheet Metal Structures</strong> – 
          Developed a method using Incremental Sheet Forming (ISF) to embed residual stress patterns via engineered surface textures. 
          Combined analytical modeling, optimization algorithms, and experiments to achieve controlled post-forming morphing and new strategies for shape control.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mold Liners Produced by Incremental Sheet Forming</strong> – 
          Designed and fabricated high-precision mold liners using ISF toolpath strategies informed by tooltip geometry and feature skeletons. 
          Demonstrated superior demolding behavior and surface finish compared to SLA-printed molds, with improved compatibility for PDMS molding.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Geometric Accuracy & International Benchmarking of Incremental Sheet Forming</strong> – 
          Led DSIF/SPIF/TPIF experiments for an ESAFORM benchmark involving 13 institutions. 
          Analyzed geometric deviations across processes and contributed data-driven insights for accuracy improvement and shared experimental standards.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hierarchical Surface Textures for Improved Coating Durability (SLIPS)</strong> – 
          Developed a combined forming–texturing approach using DSIF to enhance hydrophobicity, lubricant retention, and coating life. 
          Showed that discretized dimple textures and low-speed tool spinning significantly improve SLIPS durability under sliding contact.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Robotic English Wheel Forming Automation</strong> – 
          Designed and built a robotic English wheel platform with UR5 integration, real-time force sensing, and adaptive toolpath control. 
          Improved forming repeatability and process understanding, supporting digital manufacturing and Industry 4.0 automation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>DSIF Manufacturing of Functional Shell Structures</strong> – 
          Developed DSIF-based methods to form unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) hulls with riblet textures for drag reduction and anti-biofouling performance. 
          Demonstrated an agile, tool-free approach to low-volume, multi-functional marine components.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Robotic Power Hammer Forming at General Motors</strong> – 
          Automated a traditional power hammer forming process using FANUC robotics and Abaqus simulations to reduce manual dependence and improve repeatability. 
          Built a high-speed imaging and computer-vision setup to measure impact speed and provided data-driven insights that advanced digital forming strategies.
